# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Konsul. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development of this project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format (see [template.md](template.md)) with the following sections:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change being proposed or decided
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the [template.md](template.md) file
2. Name it with the next sequential number: `XXXX-short-title.md`
3. Fill in the sections with relevant information
4. Update this README with a link to the new ADR
5. Submit as part of your pull request

## Lifecycle

ADRs are immutable once accepted. If a decision needs to be changed:

1. Create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
2. Update the old ADR's status to "Superseded by ADR-XXXX"
3. Reference the old ADR in the new one's context
